VM(Windows Server)-Primary monitoring system with securirty tools for packet capture and log analysis. MacBook Air-Configured as a threat simulation device with the following tools: *Wireshark-Network traffic capture & analysis *Hydra-Password brute-forcing tool for login testing *Aircrack-ng Suite-Wireless network security testing(includes Airodump-ng, Aireplay-ng, Airbase-ng) *Nikto-Web vulnerability scanner *iPad-Configured for remote access into the VM/host machine and planned for basic network probing & simulated malicious activity. (FOCUS IS ON SIMULATING INTERNAL THREATS AND MONITORING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY ACROSS THE LAB ENVIRONMENT)
